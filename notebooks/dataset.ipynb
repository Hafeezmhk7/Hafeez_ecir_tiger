Just because you can gouge, doesn't mean you should. Sorry wen, but it's just too much. Besides that, it's the best thing going for hair right now in my opinion. lol! If money is no object, you must use this every single time you 'wash' your hair. My hair is usually really dry, but I'm positive it will work on oily hair as well. I don't like ANY of the scents, and it kind of 'burns' or 'tingles' too much the first time you use it. But it's a magic potion. No lie.\",\n",
